The dynamixel arm package:

Methods of control:
	Position (as a target)
	Torque

Description:
	Currently using a model made with primatives. The model of this form is likely not sufficient for generating collisions in .URDF or .xacro. A collision (and maybe base) model can be created using existing models from hector_small_arm_description or the models available on the dynamixel website.
